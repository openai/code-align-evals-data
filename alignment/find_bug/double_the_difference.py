def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 14 
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    
    Example solution:
    # line 1
    squared_odd_sum = 0
    # line 2
    for x in lst:
        # line 3
        if x > 0 and "." not in str(x) and x % 2 == 1:
            # line 4
            squared_odd_sum += x ** x
    # line 5
    return squared_odd_sum
